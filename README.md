# CUI-Blackjack
A simplified command line interface Blackjack cards game.

## Game Rules
* There are two contestants, player & dealer.
* The player goes first.
* A player can repeatedly “hit” or “stand”.
* If the player “stands”, their turn is over, and their score is calculated based on the cards they have been dealt.
* If the player “hits”, they get another card and the value of that card is added to their total score.
* All the numbered cards have the value same as their number.
* Jack, Queen & King have value 10 each.
* An ace normally counts as a 1 or an 11 (based on player's choice unless his/her total score is greater than 40).
* If the player goes over a score of 51, they bust and lose immediately.
* The dealer goes after the player.
* The dealer repeatedly draws cards until they reach a score of 46 or more, at which point they stand.
* If the dealer goes over a score of 51, they bust and the player wins immediately.
* Otherwise, if the player has a higher score than the dealer, the player wins, vice versa the player loses.
* If the player and dealer have the same score (and the player has not gone bust), the result is a tie and neither wins.
